To make importing, preparing, and managing big datasets easier, the Datasets library is supplied.  The Scikit-learn library offers resources for assessing the model's performance using F1-score and accuracy, among other measures.  Pandas is used to handle and analyze tabular data, such as reading or processing CSV files, while OpenPyXL allows findings to be exported and saved in Excel format.

        "For Experiment 2, the model was trained with fewer learning cycles and a higher number of them. This made it more accurate and helped it reach a more stable equilibrium.  It was trained over three epochs with a learning rate of 3e-5, a batch size of 16, and a weight loss of 0.01.  Every epoch had an assessment and model saving set to happen, and the best-performing model was loaded at the end.  During training, the model got better over time, as shown by the fact that both the validation accuracy and the F1-score kept going up.  The model had a validation loss of 0.4008, an accuracy of 0.9141, and an F1-score of 0.9084 by the third epoch. This means it learned and generalized better than the previous setup.  The final test results showed an accuracy of about 90.4% and an F1-score of 0.8977, which suggests that the model was able to better fine-tune its parameters when the training period was longer and the learning rate was slower.  Overall, Experiment 2 showed that raising the number of epochs and decreasing the learning rate made the model work better and the training results were more stable."
