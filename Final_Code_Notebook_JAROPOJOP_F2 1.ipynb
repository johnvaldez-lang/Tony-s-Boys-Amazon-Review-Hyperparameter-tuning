To make importing, preparing, and managing big datasets easier, the Datasets library is supplied.  The Scikit-learn library offers resources for assessing the model's performance using F1-score and accuracy, among other measures.  Pandas is used to handle and analyze tabular data, such as reading or processing CSV files, while OpenPyXL allows findings to be exported and saved in Excel format.

The model is trained for two epochs (num_train_epochs=2), allowing it to make a few passes through the dataset without overfitting. Both the training and evaluation batch sizes are set to 16 (per_device_train_batch_size=16, per_device_eval_batch_size=16), which balances memory efficiency and learning stability. The learning rate (5e-5) determines how fast the model learns; it’s small enough to ensure careful optimization. Weight decay (0.01) helps prevent overfitting by reducing the influence of overly large weights. The evaluation and save strategies are both set to \"epoch\", meaning the model is evaluated and saved after each epoch. Finally, the argument load_best_model_at_end=True ensures that the best version based on validation metrics is used. This baseline provides a reference point for later experiments, showing how the model performs under standard fine-tuning conditions."

        "In this experiment, the model undergoes a deeper training process by increasing the number of epochs to three (num_train_epochs=3), giving it more opportunities to learn patterns from the data. The batch sizes remain at 16 to maintain consistent comparison with Experiment 1. The learning rate is lowered to 3e-5, allowing smaller and more controlled updates to the model weights, which often leads to better generalization and reduced loss fluctuations. Other parameters such as weight decay (0.01) and evaluation strategy remain the same to isolate the impact of these two hyperparameter changes. As a result, the model learns more refined patterns from the text, achieving slightly higher performance metrics than the baseline while maintaining training stability. This experiment demonstrates how a moderate increase in training time and a smaller learning rate can enhance model accuracy and robustness."

Smaller batches make the model update its weights more frequently, allowing it to adapt better to variations in the data. The learning rate is further reduced to 2e-5, enabling even finer weight adjustments during training. These hyperparameter changes help the model focus on subtle differences in sentiment and improve prediction stability. Training and evaluation are still performed for two epochs with weight_decay=0.01 to control overfitting, and the model saves the best checkpoint after each epoch. Although this setup can increase training time, it often results in more consistent and detailed learning. Overall, Experiment 3 refines the model’s sensitivity and improves its ability to generalize from limited data samples.\n"

        "Across the three experiments, progressive tuning of the training hyperparameters produced noticeable improvements in model performance and stability. The baseline model (Experiment 1) established a strong foundation with good accuracy using default settings, proving that DistilBERT performs effectively even with minimal configuration. Experiment 2 improved upon this by increasing the number of training epochs and lowering the learning rate, which allowed the model to learn more deeply and achieve better generalization, reflected in higher F1 and accuracy scores. Finally, Experiment 3 refined the training process further by using a smaller batch size and an even slower learning rate, enabling more precise weight updates and consistent validation performance. Overall, the gradual adjustments from Experiment 1 to 3 demonstrated that careful fine-tuning of hyperparameters—especially learning rate, epochs, and batch size—can significantly enhance model robustness and predictive quality."
